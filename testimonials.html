	<a><br>What more can I say about Shantanu’s photography than what is already written in the beauty of his photographs?  Shantanu captured a moment in time in my life in such a way that everyone can feel the energy of that day through the photos.   In my life I have never felt as beautiful as I did when Shantanu took photos of me.   He was not afraid to take risks in his photography and his creativity seemed boundless.<br><br>
 
However, Shantanu’s photography skills speak for themselves.  If you want to see his art look at the beautiful website he designed.  The reason I am writing this testimonial is to attest to Shantanu’s professionalism, tact, and character.  Before the wedding, Shantanu’s had impeccable communication skills.  He was on time (or early) for all appointments, and he even went above and beyond by casing beautiful spots prior to the wedding.  He was in constant communication with me and was highly concerned and considerate to all my needs, wants, and dreams for my wedding.  He wasn't just a regular photographer, he felt a friend.<br><br>
 
There is nothing worse at a wedding than an annoying photographer.  Somehow Shantanu was able to get many, many family shots (both posed and candid) without ever causing anxiety or annoyance to any of my guests.  He had the innate ability of knowing what needed to happen to not only make sure he got a great shot, but to also make sure my guests were comfortable.  Shantanu was friendly, tactful, and happy.  This meant a lot to us on our big day.  Shantanu’s enthusiasm was contagious.  He was so excited to shoot our wedding.<br><br>
 
Since the wedding, I have had countless calls about how wonderful the wedding was.  Every single person commented on how friendly, energetic, and respectful our photographer was.  This was before they even saw his pictures.  Now that the photos our out, everyone wants to hire Shantanu to shoot their wedding. <br><br>
 
I highly recommend Shantanu to any group of people wanting professional, creative, and beautiful photos.  Thank you Shantanu for making us all feel beautiful! <br><br>

<a><br><br><br>Being a good photographer is not easy. It takes a lot for taking your photos to the higher levels of art and perfection. And Shantanu has certainly traveled that distance between "Clicking a photo" and "Clicking that photo". 
<br><br>Shantanu is a photographer who goes beyond capturing good pictures. He, in fact  looks at life through his camera lenses and brings his thoughts into the digital format. He has an amazing ability to see, identify and capture the wonderful things happening around us. And that distinguishes him from the rest. 
<br><br>Shantanu has a very contemporary style of photography. Each photo by Shantanu has a different signature and appears better than the previous. 
<br><br>I would call it my privilege that my daughter is among the first few subjects for Shantanu. The artistic and alluring pictures caress the innocence of the child and bring forth the best emotions. <br><br>Thanks a lot Shantanu <br><br>

<a><br><br><br>I have no words to describe how much happy we, parents of 1 year old Sharvil are, with the way his birthday and portfolio was shot by Shantanu!<br><br> Not only us, but parents of all the kids at the party have only one word to say: excellent! <br><br> Go for him if you want to have exceptionally clear, thoughtfully shot candid pictures of your event.<br><br> I am sure you will enjoy it to the fullest.<br><br>
